## 🚀 Projects

### [01 - Password Checker](./01-password-checker/)
Evaluate password strength and security against common vulnerabilities. Learn about password security best practices, entropy, and validation logic.

### [02 - Hash Generator](./02-hash-generator/)
Generate and verify cryptographic hashes using various algorithms. Understand hash functions, file integrity, and security implications.

### [03 - Secure Login CLI](./03-secure-login-cli/)
Build a command-line authentication system with security best practices including password hashing, session management, and brute-force protection.

### [04 - Port Scanner](./04-port-scanner/)
Develop a network reconnaissance tool to discover open ports and services. Learn about TCP/IP, socket programming, and ethical hacking fundamentals.

**⚠️ Ethical Use Notice**: For educational purposes and authorized testing only.

### [05 - Log Analyzer](./05-log-analyzer/)
Parse and analyze security logs to identify suspicious activities. Master log formats, pattern matching, and security event correlation.

### [06 - Vulnerability Scanner](./06-vulnerability-scanner/)
Create an automated security assessment tool for identifying web vulnerabilities. Understand OWASP Top 10 and security testing methodologies.

**⚠️ Ethical Use Notice**: For educational purposes and authorized security assessments only.

### [07 - Mini IDS](./07-mini-ids/)
Build a lightweight intrusion detection system for network traffic monitoring. Learn packet analysis, signature detection, and network security monitoring.

### [08 - Web Penetration Testing Lab](./08-web-pentest-lab/)
Set up a controlled environment with intentionally vulnerable web applications for practicing penetration testing techniques.

**🔒 Safety Notice**: Designed for isolated environments only. Do not deploy on production networks.

### [09 - SOC Automation](./09-soc-automation/)
Develop automation scripts for Security Operations Center workflows and incident response. Learn SOAR concepts and security tool integration.

### [10 - Capstone: Secure Lab Environment](./10-capstone-secure-lab/)
Integrate all previous modules into a comprehensive security monitoring and testing infrastructure. Implement defense-in-depth and complete security lifecycle management.

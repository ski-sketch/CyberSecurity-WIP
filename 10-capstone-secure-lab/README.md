# Capstone: Secure Lab Environment

## Overview
A comprehensive capstone project integrating all previous modules into a complete security monitoring and testing environment.

## Features
- Complete network security infrastructure
- Multi-tier application deployment
- Integrated monitoring and logging
- Automated security testing pipeline
- Incident detection and response system
- Security metrics dashboard

## Components
1. **Network Layer**: Firewall rules, IDS/IPS, network segmentation
2. **Application Layer**: Secure web applications with proper authentication
3. **Monitoring Layer**: Centralized logging, SIEM integration, alerting
4. **Testing Layer**: Automated vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
5. **Response Layer**: Automated incident response and remediation

## Learning Objectives
- Implementing defense-in-depth strategy
- Building a secure infrastructure from scratch
- Integrating multiple security tools
- End-to-end security lifecycle management
- Real-world security operations

## Technologies
- Docker/Kubernetes for containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Ansible for configuration management
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging
- Grafana for metrics visualization
- CI/CD pipeline integration

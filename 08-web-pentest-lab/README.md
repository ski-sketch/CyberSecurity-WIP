# Web Penetration Testing Lab

## Overview
A controlled environment for practicing web application penetration testing techniques and exploits.

## Features
- Intentionally vulnerable web applications
- Common vulnerability examples (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, LFI, RFI)
- Authentication bypass scenarios
- Session management vulnerabilities
- File upload vulnerabilities
- Practice challenges with increasing difficulty

## Learning Objectives
- Hands-on penetration testing experience
- Understanding web application attack vectors
- Exploitation techniques
- Security testing methodology
- Remediation strategies

## Technologies
- Flask/Express.js for vulnerable applications
- Docker for containerization
- SQLite/MySQL for database challenges
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend

## Lab Modules
1. SQL Injection Lab
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Lab
3. Authentication Bypass Lab
4. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
5. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
6. XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

## Safety Notice
This lab is designed to be run in an isolated environment. Do NOT deploy these intentionally vulnerable applications on production networks or public-facing servers.
